-> Utilized "localStorage" API to enable local data storage within user's browsers, ensuring tasks and user preferences were persistently stored even after page reloads or browser sessions. Implemented data synchronization algorithms to keep local storage in sync with the server, providing a seamless user experience.
-> Implemented offline support by storing critical data in "localStorage", enabling users to access and modify tasks even in the absence of an internet connection. Integrated synchronization logic to update the server-side database once the internet connection was restored, ensuring data consistency across devices.
-> Effectively managed "localStorage" to handle large datasets, optimizing read and write operations for enhanced performance. Implemented data compression techniques to reduce storage space, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval of task-related information.
-> Implemented encryption algorithms for sensitive user data stored in "localStorage", ensuring data security and confidentiality. Regularly conducted security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, enhancing the overall robustness of the application.
